The reason we are late is because we didn't think of a good design at
the beginning.


1. We were confused on what the difference
and purpose of serializing and sha1'ing something was so that dragged
us down.


2. We had many issues dealing with git and merging errors between the
four of us

3. Merge took longer than expected, so we are debugging that.
